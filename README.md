- 👋 Hi, I’m @JaredBakerCCF
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to become a software engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently in the Navy and will be transitioning out soon.  
- 💞️ I’m planning on doing an internship with MSSA for cloud application development which I will have to learn C#, ASP.net, Javascript, SQL, and HTML.
- 📫 Please reach out to me via my LinkedIn profile if you have any tips, advice, or recommendations on where I should start!
