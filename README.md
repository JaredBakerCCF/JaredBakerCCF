- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JaredBakerCCF
- ðŸ‘€ I'm currently a DevOps Engineer at Second Front Systems and was previously in the US Navy as a Cryptologic Technician.
- Most of my work has been within the Second Front Systems GitHub and GitLab repositories and I have not started any personal projects    aside from work.
